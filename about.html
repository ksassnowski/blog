  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Hi, I’m Kai.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">I’m a twenty-something software developer from Germany.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
    I recently started to really get into functional programming, especially 
    the theory behind it. This blog is where I plan on writing down the 
    things I’ve learned during my journey. My hope is it, that writing about 
    it will help me get a much deeper understanding than I would get from 
    just reading about them.
